  <title>Brandon's Story</title>

<body> 
  <h1>My name is Brandon Bernal, and this is my life visualized</h1>
  <p>I originally come from a science background, but a few years ago I knew that I had to pursue my passion in tech.
    I enjoy solving problems and am always thinking about how to improve existing solutions, so coding came naturally.
    Below is a timeline of the past 10 years of my life up until today, May 20, 2020. Please enjoy the the visualizations provided by Google Charts!
  </p>
  <div id="timeline" style="height: 500px;"></div>

  <p>Born and raised in Canada!
    (If you're lucky, then I got the Google Maps API to work and you are currently looking at a map of Canada. If not, just imgagine snow in the middle of May, with everyone around you apologizing all the time and you're halfway there!)
  </p>

  <p>I recently just completed General Aseemly Toronto's Software Engineering Immersive program. I am shocked at how much we were able to in a relatively short amount of time. Please enjoy my pie chart that visualizes a typical day at GA (yummy pie, now I'm hungry...)
